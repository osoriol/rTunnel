Hi,

The file in this folder is out of the challenge deadline and is just for fun. I had free time and wanted to try a different approach. In this version, the program uses a log of where it has been to "dig" uniquely new paths i.e., it does not retrace steps.

If you want to take a look at it you can simply swap out the old file with the same name, recompile, and run.

 Have a nice day!
